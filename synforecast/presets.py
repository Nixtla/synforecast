    """Create a pool of interpretable single-mechanism generators.

    Returns 42 pre-configured generator instances across 15 behavioral niches,
    with allocation proportional to each generator's behavioral range, so no
    domain dominates. Every instance is one named data-generating process;
    the meta-generators that randomize their own composition per series are
    left to :func:`pretraining_pool`. Until version 0.2 this function was
    called ``balanced_pool``; that name remains available as a deprecated alias.

    The list is ordered round-robin across the niches (one variant of every
    niche, then second variants, and so on), so any prefix spans as many
    distinct behaviors as possible: the first 15 entries cover all 15 niches.
    Consumers that use only the first k generators — such as
    ``generate_series`` with ``n_series < 42`` — therefore still get a
    behaviorally diverse panel.

    Behavioral niches covered:
        - ARMA + seasonality (SARIMA, 5 variants)
        - Exponential smoothing (ETS, 4 variants)
        - Long-range memory (Fractional Brownian Motion, 3 Hurst regimes)
        - Structural breaks (Regime Switching, 2 variants)
        - Volatility clustering (GARCH, 2 persistence levels)
        - Irregular cycles (Cyclic, 2 regularity levels)
        - Sparse/intermittent (Intermittent Demand, 3 patterns)
        - Multi-seasonal (Energy Load, 2 load types)
        - Sensor artifacts (IoT Sensor, 3 health states)
        - Physiological (Vital Signs, 3 patient types)
        - Smooth/rough functions (Gaussian Process, 4 kernels)
        - Deterministic chaos (Chaotic System, 3 systems)
        - Count time series (INAR, 2 innovation types)
        - Bounded/proportion data (Bounded Process, 2 models)
        - Heavy-tailed processes (Levy Process, 2 stability levels)

    The seasonal variants (seasonal SARIMA, Holt-Winters ETS, seasonal
    intermittent demand and the periodic Gaussian process) share one seasonal
    period. Unless ``seasonal_period`` is given it is derived from ``freq``
    as the number of steps in the next-larger calendar cycle: hourly data
    gets 24, daily 7, business-daily 5, weekly 52, monthly 12, quarterly 4,
    and multiples divide accordingly (``"15min"`` gives 4, ``"2h"`` gives 12).
    Integer frequencies and offsets without a calendar convention fall back
    to 12. Yearly data has no sub-annual cycle, so its period is 1 and the
    seasonal variants reduce to their non-seasonal counterparts.

    Args:
        min_length: Minimum time series length for all generators.
        max_length: Maximum time series length for all generators.
        freq: Frequency for all generators, as a pandas offset alias or integer.
        seed: Base random seed. Each generator gets seed + i for reproducibility.
            Set to None for random seeds.
        seasonal_period: Seasonal period, in time steps, for the seasonal
            variants. Defaults to None, which derives it from ``freq``.
        **base_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to all generators
            (e.g., engine, id_col, time_col, target_col).

    Returns:
        List of 42 BaseGenerator instances ready for use with SynSet.

    Examples:
        >>> from synforecast import SynSet, interpretable_pool
        >>> dataset = SynSet(

    """Create a breadth-maximizing pool for foundation-model pretraining.

    This is the pretraining-oriented counterpart to :func:`interpretable_pool`.
    It adds the diversity-targeted *meta-generators* that ``interpretable_pool``
    deliberately excludes — ``TSIGenerator`` (randomized trend/seasonal/
    irregular composition), ``TCMGenerator`` (random temporal causal graphs),
    ``KernelSynthGenerator`` (samples from randomly composed GP kernels), and
    ``MARGenerator`` (GRATIS-style mixtures of autoregressive components).
    Each resamples a fresh configuration per series, so a handful of instances
    spans a very wide distribution. By default it also includes the full
    ``interpretable_pool`` so the corpus carries interpretable single-mechanism
    behaviors alongside the meta-generators.

    Unlike ``interpretable_pool``, the default length range is wide
    (256-1024 steps), matching the longer contexts typical of pretraining.

    Args:
        min_length: Minimum series length for all generators.
        max_length: Maximum series length for all generators.
        freq: Frequency for all generators, as a pandas offset alias or integer.
        seed: Base random seed. Each generator gets a distinct offset. Set to
            None for random seeds.
        include_balanced: When True (default), prepend the full
            :func:`interpretable_pool`; when False, return only the meta-generators
            (a purely procedural pretraining corpus).
        n_meta_variants: Number of independently-seeded instances of each
            meta-generator (default 3). More instances give the meta-generators
            a larger share when series are spread evenly across the pool, as in
            :func:`generate_series`.
        seasonal_period: Seasonal period for the seasonal variants of the
            included :func:`interpretable_pool` and :func:`seasonal_pool`.
            Defaults to None, which derives it from ``freq``.
        include_seasonal: When True, append the eight :func:`seasonal_pool`
            instances (strong seasonality on a moving level) at the same
            period. Skipped silently when the period is below 2, as for yearly
            data. Recommended for quarterly and monthly targets, where it
            raised feature-space coverage on every panel tested; leave it off
            for weekly, daily, hourly, and intermittent targets, where the
            extra instances displaced useful breadth. Default False.
        **base_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to all generators
            (e.g., engine, id_col, time_col, target_col).

    Feature-space coverage benchmarks found that real quarterly and monthly
    panels with a pronounced, regular seasonal cycle whose swing grows with
    the level (tourism demand, hospital patient counts) have few near
    neighbours in :func:`interpretable_pool`. This pool adds eight configured
    instances of existing generators that fill that region: ``TSIGenerator``
    with one harmonic at the seasonal period under moderate to heavy noise,
    including persistent AR(1) and heavy-tailed variants and a weakly seasonal
    variant; noisy multiplicative and additive Holt-Winters ``ETSGenerator``
    instances with fast level adaptation; and ``SeasonalGenerator`` sines with
    level or slope breaks.

    It is meant to be **added on top of** ``interpretable_pool`` or
    ``pretraining_pool``, never to replace them or any share of them. On
    tourism, hospital, and M1 monthly panels, adding it raised the fraction of
    real series with a close synthetic neighbour by 8 to 32 points; on M4
    panels, which have no such gap, it was neutral; and on intermittent
    car-parts sales it slightly lowered coverage when it displaced the
    pretraining pool's share. As a standalone corpus it covers far fewer real
    series than the pools. It was evaluated only at quarterly and monthly
    periods; other periods are supported but untested, and its effect on
    forecasting accuracy has not been measured.

            must be at least 2, so yearly frequencies need an explicit value.
