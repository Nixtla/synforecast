    """Escape characters the generated MDX leaves in parser-hostile positions.

    Docstrings are plain text, but the generated pages are MDX, where ``{`` and
    ``<`` are syntax. Two patterns reach the output and fail Mintlify's parse:

    1. A brace in running prose is a live MDX expression, which acorn then tries
       to parse as JavaScript ("Could not parse expression with acorn").
    2. A ``<`` in running prose opens a JSX tag, so a comparison such as
       ``demand_std**2 <= demand_mean`` fails on the following character
       ("Unexpected character `=` before name"). Only a ``<`` that cannot begin
       a tag is escaped, which leaves the ``<code>``/``<details>`` markup the
       parser emits untouched.

    Both are escaped to HTML entities, which render as the original character.

    Nothing is escaped inside code or math, because neither is interpreted as
    MDX and the entity itself would be displayed. That covers fenced blocks,
    inline spans, indented blocks -- docstrings write equations as four-space
    indented blocks, which markdown reads as code -- and ``$...$`` / ``$$...$$``
    LaTeX, which is how the rest of the Nixtlaverse writes equations.

    Pipes need no handling: mkdocstrings-parser escapes them as ``\\|`` before a
    table cell can be split.
